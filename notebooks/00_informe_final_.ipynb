That's why it's important for us to recognize how different factors, such as coffee intake, affect sleep quality in humans.\n"

    "The Data Wrangling consisted of 4 main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numeric Scaling: The numeric features that we worked on included many outliers, do to this scenario, the best scaler for this type of data is a robust scaler, which scales each instance based on the columns interquartile range. This helps the data avoid any type of skewness caused by the outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal Encoding: This type of encoding consists of encoding variables based on the hierarchical placement. Few of our variables had this type of structure, thus ordinal encoding was up for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One-Hot Encoding: Other variables had no hierarchical order, thus One-Hot Encoding was the best approach for this task. One-Hot creates a binary column for each category of the orignal column, marking 1 when an instance includes that category and 0 when it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Country grouping by continents: In the country variable, many countries existed, thus the approach we decided to encapsulate each country belonging to its continent and then create a one-hot column for each contient.\n",
    "\n",
    "After, all changes were encapsulated on a column transformer which sequentially does all the transformations without the need to run every cell. The processed data was loaded to \"data/processed/processed_coffee_data.csv\""
